What is the Requirement Phase?
    The Requirement Phase is the first and most important phase of software development where the needs and expectations of the customer or users are identified, analyzed, and documented.
Purpose of the Requirement Phase
    Understand the problem to be solved
    Identify user needs
    Define system functionality
    Avoid misunderstandings later in development
What is Concept Exploration?
  Concept exploration is the early activity in software development that focuses on understanding what problem needs to be solved and what the software must do, rather than how it will be built.

 It concentrates on requirements, not implementation.
      Determine What Client Needs, Not What Client Wants
      Clients often describe solutions instead of real problems.
      Concept exploration identifies the actual needs behind the requests.

Example:

    Client wants: “Add more buttons”
    Client needs: “Faster access to features”

 The goal is to solve the real problem, not blindly follow requests.

Information Exchange Between Programmer and End-User
  Continuous communication between:
      Developers
      End-users
      Stakeholders
  
  Methods:
      Interviews
      Meetings
      Questionnaires

Prototypes
  📌 This ensures clear understanding and avoids misinterpretation.

Determine the Constraints
    Constraints define the limits within which the software must be developed.

Common Constraints:
      Cost – Budget limitations
      Deadline – Time schedule
      Reliability – System accuracy and availability
      Size – Memory and storage limits
      Performance – Speed and response time
      Platform – Hardware or OS restrictions
📌 Constraints directly affect design and development decisions.
