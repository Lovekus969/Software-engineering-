Advantages of the Waterfall Model

      Simple & easy to understand
      Very structured approach — good for beginners and academic learning.
      
      Clear stages and documentation
      Each phase (requirements → design → development → testing → deployment) is well-defined with proper documentation.
      
      Easy to manage
      Since everything is planned upfront, progress is easy to track and manage.
      
      Works well for small, stable projects
      Best when requirements are clear and unlikely to change.
      
      Good for regulated industries
      Useful where strict documentation is required (government, healthcare, banking).

 Disadvantages of the Waterfall Model

      No flexibility for changes
      Once a phase is completed, going back is difficult and costly.
      
      Late testing
      Testing happens near the end, so bugs are discovered very late.
      
      Customer feedback comes too late
      Client sees the product only after development is done.
      
      High risk for complex projects
      Not suitable for large, long-term, or evolving systems.

      No working software until the end
      There’s no usable product early in the process.
